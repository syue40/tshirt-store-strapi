# Sean's Awesome T-shirt Store Template

This is a project I'm currently working on that uses the Next.js framework for UI/frontend, Strapi as a CMS, and SQLite for a database.

The goal of this project is to test out/learn how to use a CMS. The final deliverable will be a functioning store where users can purchase \
articles of clothing using Stripe.
